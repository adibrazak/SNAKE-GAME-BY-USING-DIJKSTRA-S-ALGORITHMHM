# SNAKE-GAME-BY-USING-DIJKSTRA-S-ALGORITHMHM
A game simulation is develop based on the classic game called 'snake' that include computer controlled intelligent or Artificial Intelligence to allow the program to act as a simulation of the gameplay. Dijkstra's path finding algorithm was applied to make this happen.

In the game, user can choose to either play the game itself or choose computer to play the game. 
User can control the snake by using W(Up), A(Left), S(Bottom), D(Right) button.
When the snake is moving up, it cannot directly change its direction moving down and vice versa.
Similarly, when the snake is moving left, it cannot directly change its direction moving right and vice versa.
During the running of the program, the user can exit the program anytime by pressing 'q'.
